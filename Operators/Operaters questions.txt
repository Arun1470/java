Senario based

1 Price After Discount
	A shop offers festival discounts. The customer enters the original price and discount percentage. The program must calculate the discount amount and the final price payable after                  applying the discount.
2 Minutes to Seconds
	A student measures experiment time in minutes but needs the time in seconds. The program should convert minutes into seconds.
3 Split Bill Among Friends
	Three friends eat at a restaurant and get a single bill. They want to split the total bill equally. The program calculates how much each friend must pay.
4 Distance Travelled
	A person drives at a constant speed. Given the speed (km/hr) and time (hr), the program must calculate the distance travelled using: distance = speed × time.
5 KM to Meters
	A fitness trainer tracks running distances in meters. Athletes give distance in kilometers, so the program converts km → meters.
6 Bytes to Bits
	A computer networks student wants to convert bytes into bits. Since 1 byte = 8 bits, the program multiplies accordingly.
7 Distribute Candies
	A teacher distributes candies equally among students. The program finds how many candies each student gets and how many remain undistributed.
8 Total Cakes Made
	A bakery produces a fixed number of cakes every hour. Given cakes per hour and total hours, the program calculates total cakes made.
9 Simple Interest
	A person deposits money in the bank. Using the formula SI = (P × R × T) / 100, the program computes simple interest.
10 Salary Calculation
	A company calculates employee salary using: Basic + HRA + Allowance. The program must compute the total salary.
11 Selling Price (Profit)
	A shopkeeper sells an item at a profit. Given cost price and profit, calculate the selling price using: SP = CP + Profit.
12 Cost Price (Loss)
	A product is sold at a loss. Given selling price and loss amount, the program calculates the cost price using: CP = SP + Loss.
13 Mango Offer (Buy 3 Get 1 Free)
	A fruit shop has an offer: Buy 3 mangoes and get 1 free. Based on the mango price and total mangoes purchased, compute total mangoes received and amount to pay.
14 Pen Offer (Buy 5 Pay for 3)
	A stationery shop offers: Buy 5 pens, pay only for 3. Given price per pen and pens bought, the program calculates how many pens need to be paid for and total cost.
15 ATM Currency Notes
	An ATM dispenses money in ₹2000, ₹500, and ₹100 notes. For a given amount, calculate the number of each note required (highest denomination first).
